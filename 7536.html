This rabbitry named by my first name and middle name combined just as a fun fact about my rabbitry. After starting in <b>01/03/17</b> and trying a few breeds I have fell in Love with the breed English Lop I wanted one was I was younger and when once I found them on here, I have been breeding them ever since. I recently just started breeding Norwegian Silver Fox, Holland Lop, and Mini Rex. I am on <b>Everyday</b> so you can Pm me with any questions. My rabbitry is Closed Which clearly means this I don't sell to the public <b>AT ALL</b>. I run my rabbitry on a closed rabbitry system if you would like a kit or any of my adults that I may have from time to time you must be on my breeders list. <b>RIGHT NOW</b> I breed my litters to raise stats and I will <b>ONLY</b> breed and or sell with <b>my partners</b>.
<br />If you aren't and you would like a kit please pm me ASAP I have put my rabbitry because I have had some incidents where the public has not taken inconsideration that I work my tail off on all of my animals, and they aren't properly taken care of or just dumped in the shelters. The <b>Rabbitry/Disclaimer</b> Section still applies to this. 
<b>IF NOT ON MY BREEDERS LIST I WON'T ANSWER MESSAGES FOR KITS OR RABBITS, THEY ARE ALL LISTED AT THE BOTTOM</b></td></tr><tr><td style="background:#dbc56f;font-size:20px;text-align:center;font-family:Palatino;"><b>[header here]</b></td></tr><tr><td>text here</td></tr><tr><td style="background:#dbc56f;font-size:20px;text-align:center;font-family:Palatino;"><b>Pricing Policies</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>$10</b> per <b>100</b> stats so 900 stat kit would be <b>$90</b>
